# Video-Instrument Synergistic Network for Referring Video Instrument Segmentation in Robotic Surgery

We are excited to announce that our paper was accepted for publication at **IEEE TMI 2024**! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

This repository contains the official implementation of our paper. 
You can access the paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10595513).

# Introduction ðŸ“‘

This project introduces a new setting in surgical image segmentation, termed **Referring Surgical Video Instrument Segmentation (RSVIS)**. RSVIS aims to automatically identify and segment the target surgical instruments from each video frame, referred by a given language expression, in a more natural and flexible way
of human-computer interaction.
